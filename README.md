# Spark-Based-Lidar-Change-Detection

# Four different data partitioning algorithms are compared to do big-data based change detection of large-scale urban Lidar data

# voxel_test.py ALGORITHM1: traditional voxel_based method which divide data into voxels

# subdomain_test.py ALGORITHM2: devide data into voxels and then group voxels into subdomains with buffer

# buffer_test.py ALGORITHM3: divide data into larger voxels with buffer

# sphere_test.py ALGORITHM4: map data to spheres 

# accuracy.py Compare the result of different algorithms with the result of cloudcompare to get the accuracy of different algorithms
